WalletConnect lets users connect their wallets to your dApp easily. Here's how to integrate it in React:

1. Install WalletConnect dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @walletconnect/web3-provider web3
   ```
2. Set up the provider in your React app:
   ```js
   import WalletConnectProvider from "@walletconnect/web3-provider";
   import Web3 from "web3";

   const provider = new WalletConnectProvider({
     infuraId: "YOUR_INFURA_ID"
   });

   await provider.enable();
   const web3 = new Web3(provider);
   ```
3. Use the `web3` instance to interact with the blockchain as usual.
