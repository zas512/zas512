IPFS allows you to host static sites in a decentralized way. Here's how to deploy your site:

1. Install IPFS CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g ipfs-cli
   ```
2. Initialize IPFS and add your site folder:
   ```bash
   ipfs init
   ipfs add -r ./your-site-folder
   ```
3. Get the CID (Content Identifier) and access your site via a public IPFS gateway:
   ```
   https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<your-cid>
   ```

You can also use services like [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) for easier deployment and continuous integration.
