JsSIP is a powerful JavaScript library for implementing SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) in web applications. Here's how to set it up:

1. Install JsSIP:
   ```bash
   npm install jssip
   ```
2. Import and configure JsSIP in your app:
   ```js
   import JsSIP from 'jssip';

   const socket = new JsSIP.WebSocketInterface('wss://sip.example.com');
   const ua = new JsSIP.UA({
     uri: 'sip:username@sip.example.com',
     password: 'yourpassword',
     sockets: [socket],
   });

   ua.start();
   ```
3. Use the UA instance to make and receive calls.

_Refer to the [JsSIP documentation](https://jssip.net/documentation/) for advanced configuration._
